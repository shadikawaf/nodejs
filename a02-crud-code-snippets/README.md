<li>The MVC design pattern was my strategy to be done with this assignment. My application contents were divided into the controller file, which connected the View and the Model to make the acceptance to the user's inputs and manage the user interaction callbacks. And to handle the application data, I created the model file, while the view folder contains the necessities to control the rendering files created by the handlebars and the HTML files.

<li>I dealt with Mysql before, so dealing with MongoDB was something new for me while it is a non-relational database. I found that MongoDB was faster since it handles an enormous amount of unstructured data and has more flexible document schemas.
